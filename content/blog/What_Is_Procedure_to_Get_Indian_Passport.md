# What Is Procedure to Get Indian Passport?

We understand that the process of obtaining an Indian passport can seem daunting, but it's more straightforward than it appears. To start, we need to register on the Passport Seva Portal, where we'll fill out an application form and gather the necessary documents. Once we upload our files and make the payment, we can schedule an appointment at a Passport Seva Kendra for verification. However, there are essential steps and tips that can make our journey smoother, and knowing them can save us time and effort. Let's explore this together.

## Registration Process

We typically start the registration process for an Indian passport by visiting the official Passport Seva Portal at https://passportindia.gov.in/.

Once we're on the homepage, we select the 'Apply' section, and then we click on 'Register Now' to kick off our registration. It's crucial that we provide accurate details like our given name, surname, date of birth, and email ID.

After submitting our information, we'll receive an activation email with a link. By clicking on that link, we activate our account and create our login credentials. We need to set a strong password and select a hint question to help us remember it.

Once we get the confirmation email stating "Account Activation," we can log in using our newly created credentials.

At this point, we should familiarize ourselves with the portal's layout. Whether we're first-time users or existing users, understanding the different user roles is essential, especially since different types of passports come with specific procedures.

## Filling the Application Form

Filling out the application form for an Indian passport is a crucial step that requires attention to detail.

First, we need to select the application type, choosing between a fresh passport or a reissue. Next, we fill in our personal details, including our given name, surname, date of birth, and place of birth. If applicable, we'll also provide our marital status and spouse's name.

After that, we enter our contact information, such as our address, telephone number, and mobile number. It's important to select the type of passport booklet we want, whether it's 36 pages or 60 pages.

We should ensure accuracy throughout the process; all details must match our supporting documents. For instance, we'll need to attach proof of identity, address proof, and our birth certificate. If we're reissuing a passport, we must include details of our previous passport.

Before we submit, let's review the application thoroughly. Once everything is correct, we can click submit and proceed with the payment.

After that, we'll need to schedule an appointment at the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) to continue the process.

## Uploading Documents

Uploading documents is a vital part of the passport application process, ensuring our submission is complete and accurate.

We need to gather several essential documents, including proof of address like a voter ID or electricity bill, proof of date of birth such as a birth certificate or Aadhaar card, and photo ID proof like a PAN card.

Don't forget to include two recent passport-size photographs with a white background.

When we upload these documents, they must be in PDF format, sized between 10 KB and 500 KB, and written in English. Clarity is crucial; blurry images can lead to application delays.

If we're applying for a minor, we'll also need additional documents like their birth certificate and proof of our citizenship.

After uploading, we must verify that all documents meet the specifications. Incomplete applications can be put on hold, and we'll receive an email highlighting what's missing.

Once we've submitted everything, we can expect a status update within 48-72 hours after our application reaches the VFS India Consular Application Centre.

Let's ensure we follow all guidelines to avoid any setbacks in our passport application journey.

## Payment and Scheduling

After completing the document upload, the next step involves making payment and scheduling an appointment.

We can choose from several convenient payment options, which include credit/debit cards, internet banking, SBI Bank Challan, and UPI. It's mandatory to make the payment online to book our appointment at any Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) or Passport Office (PO).

Here's a quick overview of the payment and scheduling process:

- **Calculate Fees:** Use the passport fees calculator on the Passport Seva portal to determine the exact cost.

- **Payment Gateway:** The integrated payment gateway supports various methods, ensuring we find one that suits us.

- **Confirmation Receipt:** After payment, we'll receive a confirmation receipt immediately, which we should keep for future reference.

- **Select PSK:** Post-payment, we can select a slot at the nearby PSK, viewing available appointments based on our preferences.

Once we've made our payment and scheduled our appointment, we'll receive an SMS with the appointment details, which we can use as proof during our visit.

This step brings us closer to obtaining our Indian passport!

## Physical Verification

Once we've scheduled our appointment, the next step in the passport application process involves physical verification. After we submit our application, the passport authority notifies our local police station, which then assigns personnel to conduct the verification at our residence.

It's essential for us to be present during this visit, as the officer will confirm our details, including our address and identity. During the verification, the police officer checks our age, name, and address, ensuring everything matches our documents.

Once everything is verified successfully, the officer signs the necessary documents, and a report is sent to the Superintendent of Police Office for further processing. Additionally, the Special Branch will cross-reference our information with criminal records to maintain national security.

It's important to note that physical verification is mandatory for first-time applicants, while certain cases, like government employees or diplomatic passport holders, may skip this step.

We'll need to prepare documents like proof of date of birth, identity, and address, including original and photocopies, to ensure a smooth verification process.

## Tracking and Receiving Passport

Tracking our passport application is crucial for staying informed about its status and ensuring a smooth process. We can monitor our application through several methods, making it easier to know when our passport is on its way.

Here's how we can track our application:

- **Visit the official Passport Seva website** and select the 'Track Your Application Status' tab.

- **Enter our 15-digit file number** along with the date of birth in the prescribed format.

- **Click on 'Track Status'** to view the current application status, which may indicate if it's under review, approved, or dispatched.

- **Use the mPassport Seva app** for mobile tracking or contact the National Call Centre for assistance.

Once our passport is dispatched, it's sent via Indian Speed Post.

We can track the delivery using the 13-digit tracking number on the India Post website.

If we encounter issues, like non-delivery, we should reach out to our Regional Passport Office or visit the nearest Speed Post Centre.

Staying proactive helps ensure we receive our passport without unnecessary delays.
